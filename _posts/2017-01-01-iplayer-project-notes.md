In iPlayer I worked in the 'Catalogue and Browse' team. Our job was to help people find things to watch. In research we saw that people were generally comfortable with finding something they already had in mind. However, discovering something new to watch wasn't a great experience. We set out to change that, starting with the homepage.

We started by talking to people inside and outside the BBC. We discovered a gap between how we understood the homepage and how the public understood it.

iPlayer is lucky enough to have a fantastic editorial team, who curate the homepage and other browsing pages. However, when we watched people using the site, they remarked that they didn't understand how things ended up on the page. Many people assumed it was 'computer generated' or entirely personalised to them.

We saw that the lack of orientating devices on the page was leading to people not exploring it. Analytics backed this finding. Our hypothesis was that we could help people discover more by signposting content more clearly.

Alongside this work I conducted a competitor analysis. I synthesized the results into a colour-coded visual, which was presented around the business to show people where our offering diverged from our competitors, and uncover the logic of how they piece together their homepages.

We also found that our editorial colleagues had their own frustrations with the page. They found it inflexible and limiting. For example, there were only two slots on the page for curated collections, which often underperformed because of their design. We ran workshops with iPlayer product teams to uncover peoples assumptions and desires for a new homepage. This took the form of a co-design session where participants created their own version of the homepage, using a set of diverse components which they labelled and described to the group.  **

We also ran these sessions with members of the public, to nail down what they wanted. From this we pulled out common themes, which helped us design a better homepage for everyone.

Some key themes that emerged:

1. Genre based collections help people orient themselves and broadly match with the way people choose what to watch

2. People wanted to be clearly shown the 'best of the BBC', as chosen by us

3. Boxsets are a key part of our offering that we'd been underselling

4. People do not actively distinguish between personalised and unpersonalised 'collections' as much as we'd thought.

From these we developed a new homepage based on a framework of slices. This would enable us to experiment with new offerings much quicker, and allow more flexibility to editorial to add time-based collections, such as for big sporting events.
